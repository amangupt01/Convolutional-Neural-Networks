# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
My solutions to the programming assignments of 4th course on Deep Learning(Coursera)

## Assignment1 Part1: Convolutional Model: step by step
Implemented complete(forward and backpropagation) CNN model,including Convolutional and Pool layers, from scratch using just numpy.

## Assignment1 Part2: Convolutional model: application
Implemented a CNN model using tensorflow framework . The model prdicts the handsigns between 0-5 .

## Keras Tutorial 
Learnt to implement deep networks using Keras.

## Assignment2: Residual Networks
Made a 50 layer deep ResNet NN including various identity and convolutional blocks. Keras framework was used for implementation.

## Assignment3: Car detection with YOLO  
Object detection and localization performed using YOLO algorithm. Implemented non-max supression and filter boxing part on a pre-trained model. Used 5 anchorboxes and 19x19 grid for the 80 class classification and detection problem .
