# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
My solutions to the programming assignments of 4th course on Deep Learning(Coursera)

## Assignment1 Part1: Convolutional Model: step by step
Implemented complete(forward and backpropagation) CNN model,including Convolutional and Pool layers, from scratch using just numpy.

## Assignment1 Part2: Convolutional model: application
Implemented a CNN model using tensorflow framework . The model prdicts the handsigns between 0-5 .

## Keras Tutorial 
Learnt to implement deep networks using Keras.

## Assignment2: Residual Networks
Made a 50 layer deep ResNet NN including various identity and convolutional blocks. Keras framework was used for implementation.

## Assignment3: Car detection with YOLO  
Object detection and localization performed using YOLO algorithm. Implemented non-max supression and filter boxing part on a pre-trained model. Used 5 anchorboxes and 19x19 grid for the 80 class classification and detection problem .

## Assignment4 Part1: Art generation with Neural Style Transfer
Implemented Neural style transfer to fuse the content and style image into the generated image by minimizing the Cost function using gradient descent wuth adam's optimisation. Used keras and tensorflow framework and pretrained VGG network. 

## Assignment4 Part2: Face Recognition
Implemented a face verification and recognition system using triple cost function and Siamese Network.
